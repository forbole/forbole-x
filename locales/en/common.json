It is a unique wallet phrase that gives you a human readable format of words to backup your wallet for recovery. It is typically a phrase that allows you to access an infinite number of accounts. At its purest form it is a pattern of letters, words or associations that help you remember the information easily. It is used by Ledger, TREZOR, MetaMask, Jaxx and others.\n\nThe accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the specific \"derivation path\". Wallets dervied from this method is called \"Hierarchical Deterministic wallets\" or HD wallets. Forbole X allows you to import a wallet using the secret recovery from different derivation paths.\n\nHere is an example of what it should look like:\n\nreview cereal bean admit critic oven piece ginger engage dog donor safe amount front swamp recycle west rebel one erosion vicious access salt faint\n\nRemember: We do not save your wallet password and secret recovery phrase in our server, once forgotten, it cannot be recovered and you cannot access to your fund from the corresponding wallets.",
