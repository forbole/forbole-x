It is used by Ledger, TREZOR, MetaMask, Jaxx and others.\n\nThe accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the technical “path”. imToken allows you to import a wallet using the mnemonic from different paths. However, you cannot export a private key on imToken.\n\nHere is an example of what it should look like:\n\nscissors invite lock maple supreme raw rapid void congress muscle digital elegant little brisk hair mango congress clump\n\nRemember: We do not save your wallet password and mnemonic in our server, once forgotten, it cannot be recovered.",
